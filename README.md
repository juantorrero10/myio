## MYIO
An inferior and annoying alternative to stdio for c.
I left a small implementation (main.c) to show how to use it.


## ðŸ§° Requirements for compiling:
- **CMake**
- **Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC)** or **Build Tools for Visual Studio**, although it may work with gcc
-> Compiled library (myio.dll) and implementation (myio_test.exe: main.c), should build in ./build/Release.

Check if tools are installed:
```bash
cmake --version
cl
